# Embedded-CENG447
All Labs for CENG447. Most *.asm codes was written on Windows. While it is my intention to write all *.cpp code on a linux system and
use avrdude and avr-gcc tools from terminal.

## Note:
Lab 1 does not exist since it was a simulation lab and the code was already provided by the TA
